How to check if piece has correct position?
    Original picture has positions
    Compare piece with its position by id/number
Should we care how split picture on pieces?
Should I consider possible form/types of pieces?

Model
    Position
        id
    Piece
        position_id
        ? side

    Board
        - positions: Position[][]
        + putPiece(piece): bool
        + isCompleted()

    Game
        - board
        - pieces

    System
        + createGame(size, picture?): Game

Patterns
    Singleton - System
    Factory - make game/pieces
